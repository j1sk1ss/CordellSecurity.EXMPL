Simple idea for setting IP to nickname.</br>
For example you, some person use VPN with 193.159.11.123 IP. </br>
In server dir find file, called "player_whitelist.txt" and add new line: </br>
```
nickname:193.159.11.123
```

Now, this player can enter to game only under provided host. </br>
In other hand, you can allow to enter under any IP for provided player: </br>
```
nickname:any
```

This plugin also works like whitelist.
